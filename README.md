talkingPerl
===========

Talking Perl is a concept I thought of when I was bored one day. I decided I wanted to dive back into perl programing
as well as Java and PHP and MySQL. So I thought what would be a nice and cool, easy going chill project would be a package
that would allow your computer to communicate with you. Eventually I think I'll try and get it so that it starts once the
computer is powered up and the user is logged in. Then periodically the computer will ask one of several question. One of
which will be if your still there. That question will be timed and if you don't answer within so many seconds the program
will log you out. I'll even try and include a pandora radio module.
